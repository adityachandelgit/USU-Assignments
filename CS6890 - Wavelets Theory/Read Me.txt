1. Since the sample had 319 values, I have removed last 63 values to make the sample size in power of 2, i.e. 256 values.

2. Because of the reduced sample size, there may be discrepancies in the answers of the problems.

3. For the second problem, I have answered the question in the code comments of TemperatureAnalysis.java file.

4. To run either of the problems in eclipse IDE, click on the package (problem1, problem2,) under src and then click 'Run'.

5. If any of my answers is unclear, please contact me at: aditya.tech07@gmail.com
